# Error-Tracker
This application allows a user to create new projects and record any errors on those projects. The user can add and remove other users as collaborators on projects. Users can post comments on projects as a whole and also on individual errors. Users can also leave projects, edit the project description, and edit/delete errors. Some general change logs are recorded on projects, like when an error was edited and by whom.
